  title: "Symfony ðŸ’š Kubernetes: dynamic feature-review environments"
  extract: >
    Docker has been a part of our development environments for long as of now. But its usage in production had not
    followed the same adoption curve, and it's instead rising only in the last years, mainly due to Kubernetes.
    But Kubernetes is not only a simple tool to port your containers into production, it goes beyond that! It lets
    (and forces) us developer embrace the twelve-factor approach, creating real cloud-native applications, where
    everything is parametrized and properly isolated.
    In this talk we'll see how a Symfony application can be easily packaged, parametrized and deployed using Docker,
    Kubernetes and Helm, up to the point of having one-click deployments of per-branch environments, a tool that makes
    review/QA of a feature really fast & easy.

  title: Symfony + AWS Lambda
  extract: >
    Serverless services, like AWS Lambda, have been proven useful to solve a wide range of problems, and its use is
    growing rapidly. Recently, the possibility to use the PHP runtime in Lambda was added, so why not trying to use our
    favourite framework? How can we make the most from a serverless approach? What are pros and cons? In this session
    we will analyze the necessary steps to set up a Symfony4 project in Lambda and deploy it.

  title: Head first into Symfony Cache, Redis & Redis Cluster
  extract: >
    Symfony Cache has been around for a few releases. But what is happening behind the scenes? Talk focuses on how is it
    working, down to detail level on Redis for things like datatypes, Redis Cluster sharding logic, how it differs from

  title: Using API platform to build ticketing system (translations, time zones, ...)
  extract: >
    Why is API platform a way to go and the new standard in developing apps? In this talk, I want to show you some real
    examples that we built using API platform including a ticketing system for the worldâ€™s biggest bicycle marathon and
    a social network that is a mixture of both Tinder and Facebook Messenger.
    We had to tackle problems regarding the implementation of tax laws in 18 different countries, dozens of translations
    (including Arabic), multiple role systems, different timezones, overall struggle with a complicated logic with an
    infinite number of branches, and more. Are you interested? Sign up for the talk.

  title: Great APIs with Symfony and Open Source Software
  extract: >
    Nowadays offering a REST API has become a must for most of the businesses.
    Offering a good documentation, validating properly the requests, having descriptive error messages, supporting
    multiple versions, retrieving data, persisting data, handling rate limitations and many other things can be not an
    easy task.
    This talk is a walk-through on how to build a rich, RESTful (Level 3 including HATEOAS) API for web applications
    using Symfony-related components and bundles.
    The result will be a standard, documented, validated and easy to maintain API, that users will enjoy and developers
    love to build.

  title: Master-slave and sharding with Doctrine, together at last
  extract: >
    Even though you hear all these talks about scaling and infinite possibilities, the examples that truly match your
    use case are few and far between. So when we set out to make Nuvola (our greenfield Symfony application) use both
    sharding and a master slave approach at the same time, we faced a variety of issues and none of the solutions out
    there were a perfect match. We dealt with having Doctrine handle both features at the same time, possible delays in
    propagation from master to slave, and a whole class of bugs we may or may not have introduced with this change. Is
    this issue surfacing just now because of this change? Was it there all along and we just never noticed? This is not
    a story about how things look in a perfect world, this is about what we had, what we set out to do, and how we made
    it work.

  title: Creating imports like a pro with Symfony
  extract: >
    Having to import a bunch of data is a common task and doing it efficiently is a difficult thing to do. In this talk
    I will go through an example and show you common limiting factors, how to identify issues and how to make bulk
    imports memory efficient and fast.
